# BD TECH Assessment Submission

## Description
This repository contains my submission for the technical assessment, which includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files as per the coding challenge requirements.

## Assumptions
1. **Browser Compatibility**: I assumed that the web application should be compatible with modern web browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. I have tested the application on these browsers to ensure compatibility.
2. **Responsiveness**: I assumed that the application should be responsive and display correctly on various devices including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones. I have used media queries and tested the application on different screen sizes to ensure responsiveness.
3. **Functionality**: I assumed that the application should meet the functional requirements specified in the coding challenge. I have implemented the required features according to my understanding of the requirements.
4. **Security**: I assumed that the application should follow basic security practices such as sanitizing inputs to prevent XSS attacks and ensuring that sensitive data is handled securely. I have implemented basic security measures based on this assumption.
